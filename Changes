Revision history for Perl extension Math::Random::MTwist.

0.09  2014-04-11
* Code cleanup.
* On Win32 use timeseed() for fast/good/bestseed() and srand() because there is
  no /dev/(u)random and we don't want mtwist's millisecond-resolution fallback.

0.08  2014-04-05
* Moved timseed() from MTwist.pm to MTwist.xs.
* Removed Safefree() call from get_seeds_from_av(): Was unnecessary because we
  croak() anyway and silly because we can't free stack addresses ...
* More tests.

0.07  2014-04-01
* Added rd_double().
* Win32 seems to need dTHX in some places in mtwist.c and randistrs.c.
* Changed =head2 to =item in POD to keep TOC on CPAN small.

0.06  2014-03-29
* FIX: MTwist.xs: srand() minimum items is 1 not 0.

0.05  2014-03-29
* Added missing _timeseed().
* Moved savestate() and loadstate() from MTwist.pm to MTwist.xs.

0.04  2014-03-28
* Added a function-oriented interface.
* Renamed rds_* to rd_*.
* Added get_seeds_from_av() to fill the seed array for seedfull().
* More tests.

0.03  2014-03-27
* Moved most methods from MTwist.pm to MTwist.xs for even more speed.

0.02  2014-03-26
* Initial release

0.01  Unreleased
